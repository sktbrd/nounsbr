There are two levels of participation: DAO Members & the Purple Community.\
You become a DAO Member by purchasing a Purple token at Auction. DAO members have a governance vote, can submit proposals, and can vote on Prop House grants.\
You are a Purple Community member if you join our Telegram, build on the protocol, cast about the DAO or help propose, organize, and execute on small grants and proposals.\
Purple is a permissionless DAO â€“ all you need to do is organize your squad and make something happen.
