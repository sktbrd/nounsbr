title: What is the relationship between Farcaster & Purple
order: 5
---

Purple is an independent ecosystem DAO. Our goal is to proliferate and expand the Farcaster protocol and ecosystem. Our treasury will be used to fund those kinds of projects. We have no governance rights to the Farcaster protocol or client.

Merkle Manufactory is the company behind the Farcaster protocol and official client.

We have (permissionlessly) allocated 10% of our token to farcaster.eth, which is owned by Merkle Manufactory, as a good stewards of both the Farcaster protocol and Purple.

**tldr**; there is no official connection to the company that makes Farcaster, this is a permissionless builder DAO on top of an open protocol.
