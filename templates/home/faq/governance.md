title: Governance Slow Start
order: 4
---

PurpDAO.eth have given themselves a special veto right to ensure that no malicious proposals can be passed while the Purple supply is low. This veto right will only be used if an obviously harmful governance proposal has been passed, and is intended as a last resort.

Purple will revoke this veto right when they deem it safe to do so. This decision will be based on a healthy Purple distribution and a community that is engaged in the governance process.
