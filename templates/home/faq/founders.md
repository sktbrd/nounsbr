title: How does founder allocation work?
order: 3
---

Allocation gives a custom % of tokens over a custom period of time to specified wallet addresses. In NounsDAO, this is 10% of tokens for 5 years (token 0,10,20 etc) for the DAO founders. In Purple, 10% of tokens until 2050 are allocated to the PurpDAO.eth multisig, 10% is allocated to Farcaster.eth and 1% is allocated to NounsDAO.

Founder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of auctions. Tokens are sent directly to the founder multisig and auctions continue on schedule with the next available ID.
